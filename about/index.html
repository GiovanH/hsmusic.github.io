                    <p>Welcome to my fan-made Homestuck music wiki!</p>
                    <p><a href="https://www.homestuck.com/">Homestuck</a> has always been an incredible creative collaboration, and especially beloved by the community and critical in that collaboration is the webcomic and world's humongous soundtrack, comprising well over 500 tracks by dozens of musicians and artists. This wiki aims to be an interesting and useful resource for anyone interested in that music, as well as an archive for all things related.</p>
                    <p>Pertaining to the history of this site: it was originally made as a remake of Homestuck's official <a href="https://homestuck.bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a>, which saw its content particularly reduced on <a href="https://twitter.com/hamesatron/status/1187842783618297856">10/25/19</a>. This site aims to be a more reliable resource and reference: track art (conspicuously missing from the Bandcamp) is archived here, solo albums (among other missing albums, like <a href="album/squiddles/index.html">Squiddles!</a>) are all indexed in the one place, and URLs will always stay consistent. And of course, also included are links for listening on Bandcamp and other services.</p>

                        <li><a href="https://homestuck.bandcamp.com/">Homestuck's Bandcamp</a>, the official host of Homestuck's music: I got almost all the album listings and basic track info from here.</li>

                        <li><a href="https://recordcrash.com/nsnd.html">NSND</a>: leitmotifs! Thanks to this site in combination with credits on the bandcamp and artists' own commentary, this wiki is a rather comprehensive resource for leitmotifs and other track references.</li>

People have shared a ton of ideas and suggestions with me, and I <i>cannot</i> emphasize enough how motivating it is to share a project with like-minded folx interested in making it better with you. Extra thanks to the subreddit mods for pinning the discussion post and keeping it there so long - I received a ton of feedback I've loved working with and talking about the project with other people there has been a joy. :)</li>
