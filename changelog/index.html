                <h3>homepage</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>a new <a href="index.html">Changelog</a> page! you are probably reading it now.</li>
                    <li>two new albums: <a href="../album/rust-apocalypse/index.html" style="--fg-color: #7848e4; --bg-color: #222222; --theme: 0">Rust Apocalypse</a> by Willow Ascenzo, and the follow-up to <a href="../album/beforus/index.html" style="--fg-color: #ff00c5; --bg-color: #222222; --theme: 0">Beforus</a>, <a href="../album/ancestral/index.html" style="--fg-color: #ff0300; --bg-color: #222222; --theme: 0">Ancestral</a>!

                <ul>
                    <li>flash pages now have links at which they can be listened, besides just on homestuck.com! most importantly: links to HD recordings, so they can be watched at good resolution on any device</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>track pages</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>previously, all tracks required a URL to be added to the wiki; now, for tracks which don't have any links to be listened at online (but are still referenced by other tracks), they have been added alongside a message saying there aren't any listening links</li>
                    <li>as such, another full pass through <a href="https://homestuck.net/music/references.html">NSND</a> has been completed, and many tracks which weren't present on the wiki before have been added to the newly reorganized <a href="../album/unreleased-tracks/index.html" style="--fg-color: #ff7bf7; --bg-color: #222222; --theme: 0">Unreleased Tracks</a> album!</li>

                </ul>
                <h3>miscellaneous</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>a new navigation header added to every album, track, flash, and listing page, making the site considerably more usable on any device</li>
                    <li>the header has links to the previous and next (or random) track/flash, and chronology links have been moved into the header too, so you don't need to scroll to the bottom of the page to access them</li>
                    <li>on top of redoing the sidebar-header layout, changes to styling (collapsing the sidebar when the screen isn't very wide, for example) have made the site usable on mobile devices now!</li>
                    <li>also, some changes to the way pages are generated, to make the site usable from hit command-line web browser <a href="https://lynx.browser.org/">Lynx</a></li>
                </ul>

                    <li>a &lt;meta&gt; tag has been added to the homepage, so hsmusic's search result that comes up when you look up "homestuck music wiki" is a lot prettier</li>

                    <li>because it's easy to see where tracks are referenced now, dim contribution lines (showing tracks which reference a track by the specific artist, but were not otherwise contributed to by them) have been removed</li>
                    <li>the lists aren't numbered anymore because, with this grouping, it was sort of ambiguous whether that referred to a track's position in the album or if it was a continuous counter of the artist's contributions (it was the latter); both such counters can now be displayed by holding still the cursor over a contribution line for a moment</li>
                    <li>removed a few referenced-track contributions i'd missed switching to the new format (distinct reference lists) earlier</li>

                <h3>album pages</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>album name, release date, track listing, cover art &amp; art credits</li>
                    <li>solo albums also show their artist</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>track pages</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>track name, release date, artists (musicians), cover art &amp; art credits</li>
                    <li>links to listen to the track too (and code to convert URLs into human-readable site names, e.g. "YouTube" or "Bandcamp" or "(External)")</li>
                    <li>rudimentary leitmotif reference credits in the form of "Contributors" list</li>
                    <li>contributors list also contains credited collaborators on the track, e.g. producers, vocalists</li>

                <h3>artist pages</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>name, track and art credits</li>
                    <li>artist pages look quite different from today but serve the same purpose of listing their contributions</li>
                    <li><a href="../changelog-misc/old-artist-page.png">here's an example</a></li>
                    <li>credits are all in one numbered list; most are just the name of the track contributed to and the album it's from</li>
                    <li>for tracks where an artist made a specific contribution, that's mentioned too, e.g. "Sburban Countdown (arrangement)"</li>
                    <li>if a musician's contribution is simply a track which was referenced, the line for that contribution is slightly dim (it still contributes to the counter)</li>
