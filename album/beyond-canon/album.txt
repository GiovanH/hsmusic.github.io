    (vocalizations of "ee" and "ah")<br>always<br>you --<br>(vocalizations of "ee" and "ah" continue)<br>-- made a monster<br>ha ha ha<br>ha ha-ah
    <i>"You sit up there all day long and do <b>nothing.</b> Except come down and make tea.</i>
    you just made a monster (x4)

    my contribution to Homestuck^2's first album: exclusion zone from Beyond Canon.
    i can't express how meaningful it was to be able to write something for this, so i won't try. all i can say is thank you, thank you, thank you.
    you have given me a home i would be happy to be stuck in.

    It was fun to play lots of nice low 7 string guitar chugs and to try and make it sound as villainous as possible. :)

    Eight years ago, I made a track for a webcomic called Homestuck for a music competition.
    Today, I'm happy to announce the official release of my track, SPLIT REALITY, on the newest Homestuck album, Beyond Canon!!!
    Enjoy <3
    I'm also officially apart of the Homestuck music team, and will be working with them further for more releases~
    <3 <3 <3

    K I wanna be real with y'all here.
    This track means a lot to me in more than one way. Between a bunch of depressive episodes and just outstanding amounts of imposter syndrome, I had a lot of anxiety that I wouldn't even be able to make a track that was in the ballpark of "good", let alone at all worthy of being on the first official album of Homestuck^2. And for a while there, I wasn't really making things I was at all enjoying or proud of. I was worried of making something that wasn't "homestuck" enough, or wasn't something people were really expecting. But the support of the amazing Homestuck music team helped contribute to a track I can firmly say I'm proud of, and even being included on this album means the world to me.
    So I really, really do hope you guys enjoy this <3

Lyrics:
    Smoke is all I breathe,<br>is all you hear, is all in me.<br>Taste the drier air.<br>There’s nothing left.
    Letters fill the empty space.<br>There’s so much space that’s left untouched.<br>Running scares me more than God,<br>but staying can’t sustain.
    The sparks of fire, earthbound,<br>have found your home. Be gone now.<br>It’s not your fault, you know this.<br>But the leaving is just the same.
    I feel the wind beneath my arms.<br>It’s warmer now than I recall.<br>Have you heard the news today?<br>They closed the school.
    You and I have been through this,<br>have been through that, have been at ease.<br>Nothing scares me more than God,<br>and Nothing cannot sustain.
    The sparks of fire, earthbound,<br>have found your home. Be gone now.<br>It’s not your fault, you know this.<br>But the leaving is still the same.
    You sent me fire.<br>Fire, I’ll tear my throat out.<br>Burn my blackened lips.<br>You gave me fire.<br>Fire, I’ll tear my heart out.<br>I’d rather tear my heart out.<br>But I can’t stay here.
    The sparks of fire earthbound<br>have found your home. Be gone now.<br>It’s not your fault, you know this.<br>But you can’t help but turn around.<br>The embers haven’t faded.<br>The love you left, unmade.<br>It’s not your fault, you know this.<br>But the leaving is still the same.

    So I did a thing (was a small part in doing a thing). My track is The Leaving, but honestly give this whole thing a listen. I'm very proud to be included here. Happy Homestuck Day!

    as promised...
    me in 2016: I should join at least one Homestuck fan project before the comic ends, this may be my last chance
    me in 2020, somehow on the team of people who made the music that inspired me, making music for a comic that's still going: well,
    (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEIWdGAOBuc">YouTube</a>)
    It's about beginnings in endings...building the world in the comic's early pages, and rebuilding the world after the end. But also, all interpretations are valid.

    <blockquote>Holy crap. Impeccable. I might transcribe this for my music project.</blockquote>
    This might make it a bit easier — I made a notated blueprint before I started producing it (notated on two piano grand staves, because that's easy for me to parse, but it's certainly not a playable two-piano score). It's not 100% accurate to how it wound up (and I'm not going to fix it, because I don't have any use for an accurate "score"), but if you take this as a slightly-flawed transcription you can probably get the rest relatively easily. <a href="misc/narrative-command-blueprint.pdf">(link!)</a>

Lyrics:
    it’s been a little bit since the last time we all talked<br>so...how are all of you doing?<br>i know that i have been a bit unkind to you all<br>and i’m trying to undo it
    we thought this ended years ago but it survived<br>i've forgotten far too often why i even recognize these faces<br>that don't have names placed with them<br>inside my hazy brain, but then<br>there's too much to begin to touch on here
    i’m<br>pulled back<br>once again<br>and i told myself,<br>told myself,<br>told myself<br>i wouldn’t be on this adventure
    but i’m haunted by<br>all of these memories<br>that i have of four kids<br>and the game they played together
    i burned the bridges thoroughly but still everyone's trusting me again<br>and i should be relieved but it happened so suddenly<br>and i know in my heart i haven't earned this,<br>but everyone acts like my concern isn't a problem<br>like nothing is wrong with my very involvement
    but i know how the song ends
    i can’t begin to list the times that i’ve walked<br>along this road and concluded<br>that nothing that i’ve done here will make sense, in the end<br>but i find that kind of soothing

    might fuck around and release some stuckhome syndrome music today...
    by that i mean i'm definitely releasing some stuckhome syndrome music today. if all goes well i'll probably have it up in like...maybe a little over an hour?
    no promises but you know. i am just a little creacher

    i wasn't technically lying

    might as well talk a tiny bit about this song, Four Kids (and a Game They Played Together), since people are responding to it way more strongly than i kind of expected
    the original version of the track from yeaaaaars ago i wrote as an instrumental i intended to be the "homestuck end credits theme," which ended up not panning out for a bunch of reasons, but the song was always a fave of mine, and stuck around on my hard drive until i polished it up as the finale of the main portion of Stuckhome Syndrome P1V1. i still love this version of the song very much.
    i had a vocal version brewing in my head for ages. literally from before stuckhome syndrome was released. i mean, the first line (it's been a little bit since the last time we all talked/so how are all of you doing?) was just a sudden thing about me getting volume 10 together
    i never had anything besides that opening line, though, not really. for ages i thought i'd finish it up for the last stuckhome volume (i haven't even put the 2nd together...but i will! this year probably?) but a lot  ended up hitting me in the interim and i didn't have time for it
    about five months ago i was contacted to be a part of the homestuck 2 music team and was told the lowdown: it was a clean slate, and a chance to establish the musical rockbed for homestuck 2 going forward. no quotes of hs1 songs whatsoever, but we'd be making new songs TO quote
    i messed around with a few other demos but it was pretty quick for me to settle on deciding to do this. since four kids was never actually released as part of homestuck proper, it ended up feeling like the perfect time to pull the track together for real.
    though the instrumental of the new version came together with steady work over the past few months the actual vocals and lyrics didn't coalesce until about two weeks ago. i had messed around with dozens of variants until then; the only stuff finalized earlier was the chorus
    singing it was fresh hell because it's stretching my range extremely hard, but i didn't want to do pitch correction. on the final track there is some on the backing vocals for two parts, mostly to help finish the thing quickly, but the majority of it is natural
    it was endless, endless retakes and it still sound bad to my ears but i think the roughness maybe helps the emotional quality of the song? i guess?
    for my part, i'm just glad it's done and i'm glad it's apparently good. anyway. thanks
    oh and lastly i guess speculate all you want about the meaning of the song but i'm not going to engage with any of that stuff because i kinda feel like what the song is feeling is clear without my input on that front
    but. yeah. thanks again. <3
