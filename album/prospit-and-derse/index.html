                <blockquote>
                    <p><i>Solatrus:</i></p>
                    <p><b>Propsit & Derse 1 Year Anniversary Commentary</b></p>
                    <p>It’s really insane that it’s been one year since this album came out. And what’s even more remarkable is how much I’ve improved as a musician since then. But let’s turn the clock back and I’ll tell you the story of how it all started.</p>
                    <p>This whole thing is going to be done in the order of how I created the album, which was Derse and then Prospit, but not precisely in that order.</p>
                    <p><b>Where It All Began</b></p>
                    <p>It wasn’t too long after Volume 6 was released that I started debating a solo album. I knew that I enjoyed contrasts, but I really loved ethereal sounds. I had actually considered doing a Medium album, but Clark beat me to it. However, Prospit & Derse had already been started before Medium was out.</p>
                    <p>So where did the album’s concept come from? Well, a conversation I had with Lexxy, actually! We were brainstorming ideas and we got into talking about the moons, and then the idea sunk in for me to do a solo album, which was actually called Derse/Prospit (yes, slash included).</p>
                    <p>Pretty cool, huh? And Lexxy helped with the album cover, which is really great.</p>
                    <p>But anyway, I eventually started working on some of the music. I knew Prospit was going to be a struggle for me, because I had never written any proper orchestral music at the time. And the first song I created was <a href="https://soundcloud.com/solatrus/apathy-empathy-wip-2">this</a>, albeit it was in drum and bass and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/solatrus/apathy-empathy-wip">not nearly</a> as polished sounding.</p>
                    <p>But I really didn’t like the direction, so I ended up scrapping it and trying to figure out how to start over. And then Medium was released and I was incredibly inspired and remembered how great atmospheric music is. Clark Powell single-handedly saved this album from being killed before it even got anywhere.</p>
                    <p>And that’s when I created Darkened Streets.</p>
