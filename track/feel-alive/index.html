            <blockquote>
                <p><i>Luke Benjamins:</i></p>
                <p>I actually wrote the melody for this track almost five years ago, for a project that never got off the ground. As far as I can remember, I didn't have any particular inspiration when I wrote it, musical or otherwise. It's the catchiest tun eI've ever made, yet I couldn't tell you how it came to me exactly. This version is a completely unique take on this melod ycompared to the original context, giving it a very different Feel. I wasn't able to do any of the audio production for this track, but I did guide RJ as to how I Feel it should be put together. We ended up pushing the deadline too much with this one, and there are still a couple things I wish had been changed, but like with any creative work, you need to draw the line somewhere, lest you polish it endlessly.</p>
                <p>In the end, I'm gald to finally share itw ith the world in some form, and I hope the world enjoys it.</p>
                <p><i>Robert J! Lake:</i></p>
                <p>This is really Luke's song. I started the project file but he made it his own. The crow noises are mine.</p>
                <p><i>PJ Tush:</i></p>
                <p>Being so high energy, I wanted to make the piece as colorful as possible, but not unattractively saturated. Initially I planned on reflecting the characters in dream bubbles of their respective colors, but decided to depict them in full mugshot instead.</p>
                <p>Each character is lightly engulfed in a colroful overlay in front of the chaotic, perpetually expanding infinity of gay space.</p>
                <p><i>Fenn:</i></p>
                <p><i>Feel</i> is a very powerful song full of energy. We were inspired by the tension filled events occuring during the 3 year span of time between those stuck on the troll meteor, flying through space towards an unknowing and terrifying future.</p>
                <p><i>Mika B.:</i></p>
                <p>When rendering the final rendition of the track art piece, I hoped to give it a complete finish that would accustom the piece's lovely concept art. I enjoyed working to convey the spectacular energy Jade is known to behold, particularly with her hair.</p>
                <p>Overall, this piece was a great enjoyment to work on, and I was able to accompany two great artists in their work to create art to represent <i>Feel</i>, as well as the teens' spiraling adventure on the gay meteor.</p>
