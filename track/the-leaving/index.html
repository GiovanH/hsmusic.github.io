                    <p>Smoke is all I breathe,<br>is all you hear, is all in me.<br>Taste the drier air.<br>There's nothing left.</p>
                    <p>Letters fill the empty space.<br>There's so much space that's left untouched.<br>Running scares me more than God,<br>but staying can't sustain.</p>
                    <p>The sparks of fire, earthbound,<br>have found your home. Be gone now.<br>It's not your fault, you know this.<br>But the leaving is just the same.</p>
                    <p>I feel the wind beneath my arms.<br>It's warmer now than I recall.<br>Have you heard the news today?<br>They closed the school.</p>
                    <p>You and I have been through this,<br>have been through that, have been at ease.<br>Nothing scares me more than God,<br>and Nothing cannot sustain.</p>
                    <p>The sparks of fire, earthbound,<br>have found your home. Be gone now.<br>It's not your fault, you know this.<br>But the leaving is still the same.</p>
                    <p>You sent me fire.<br>Fire, I'll tear my throat out.<br>Burn my blackened lips.<br>You gave me fire.<br>Fire, I'll tear my heart out.<br>I'd rather tear my heart out.<br>But I can't stay here.</p>
                    <p>The sparks of fire earthbound<br>have found your home. Be gone now.<br>It's not your fault, you know this.<br>But you can't help but turn around.<br>The embers haven't faded.<br>The love you left, unmade.<br>It's not your fault, you know this.<br>But the leaving is still the same.</p>

                    <p>So I did a thing (was a small part in doing a thing). My track is The Leaving, but honestly give this whole thing a listen. I'm very proud to be included here. Happy Homestuck Day!</p>

                    <p>When I first heard the song i thought about Rosebot leaving Kanaya, but as I listened to it I realized it could fit so many other characters as well. Especially Dirk, Terezi and Rose leaving earth C, Dirk thinking there is nothing left to do on Earth C and seeing leaving as the only way to move forward, Terezi leaving after John's death (mentions of air and wind), and Rose not wanting to hurt Kanaya by leaving but having no other choice. And as soon as I realized this, I had this picture in mind. Most of my WIPS shows the progress of the piece; sketch, color modifications, cleaning etc... Thanks to the beyond canon anthology team for their tips and advice!</p>
