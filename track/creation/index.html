            <p>Artist commentary:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><i>Tyler Dever:</i></p>
                <p><i>(original commentary)</p>
                <p>The song that means more to me than any song I've ever written and possibly will again. Sburb is all about creating worlds, thus the resolution of the album comes after the storm (Rapture). No matter how harsh the process may be, the result is beauty and endless potential. This song is completely based around the hemiola motif and the origin of it. It is also designed like a day. The song starts off quiet and slow as the sun rises and slowly gets more complex and full fledged as it rises until mid day when it is most busy. As the sun sets into the later half of the day the song slows down and gets quieter toward the sunset. It resolves with the Homestuck Anthem to imply the loop to the beginning. Worlds are created and the process of Skaia starts again.</p>
                <p><i>(commentary redux)</i></p>
                <p>This movement is framed as a sunset. Starting off quiet, building to a peak before shying away to where it started.</p>
                <p>You can definitely see that I was influenced into writing music from the works of Philip Glass and that is in full force here, but even in retrospect I feel like I put a great personal spin on it.</p>
                <p>As the sun sets, there's a final recall of the Homestuck Anthem. This movement was originally the last movement before I added the Revelations movements but it fit too well and I could not bring myself to remove it.</p>
                <p>I wrote this the weeks following the passing of my grandmother. It will always be for her and for everything she did for me.</p>
