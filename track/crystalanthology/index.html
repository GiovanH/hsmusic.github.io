            <p>Artist commentary:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><i>Solatrus:</i></p>
                <p><i>(original commentary)</i></p>
                <p>It’s a chill drum and bass song, and one of my best productions for Homestuck. It was also my first remix since I made that Skaia remix.</p>
                <p>Have I mentioned that Alex Rosetti’s compositions are pretty incredible? They are. You should go give him some love.</p>
                <p><i>(commentary redux)</i></p>
                <p>Woo, my first official remix since my Skaia remix on Volume 5!</p>
                <p>So as I’ve probably mentioned, I’m a huge fan of Alex Rosetti’s work, and this song is absolutely no exception. I had been wanting to do something with Crystalanthemums since first listening to it. Coincidentally, it immediately proceeded my Skaia remix.</p>
                <p>At the time, I really had no idea on who anyone was on the team, so it never really sunk in that I should do that remix until December of 2010.</p>
                <p>Obviously at this point I had gained an interest in drum and bass music, which explains the sound, yet I still had a very soft and ethereal sound reminiscent of the original song.</p>
                <p>Of course, I really pushed the energy up, which made it a lot of fun. I jokingly said to Alex after Volume 6 came out that while his song was at the top of the echeladder, my remix was god tier, in part due to Vriska in her God Tier outfit being there. :D</p>
                <p>Anyway, on to the song.</p>
                <p>So the song opens with a really interesting sounding ostinato, which is actually the same notes that open Crystalanthemums: E, D, B, A, E, D, B, D.</p>
                <p>However, I really gated the length of the note to make it become such a short blip that the sound barely registers. On top of that I gave it a delay and combined with the gate it sounds nothing like the original motif.</p>
                <p>And then when I open the gate on the note length you hear the ostinato faaaaar better.</p>
                <p>A lot of people missed this, actually. :D</p>
                <p>I have to say I really love the chord progression Alex went with in Crystalanthemums, and it was incredibly fun to make that bassline, which is actually a layered bass, but not a note-for-note bass. This is actually a pretty common thing to do, with the lower bass just playing simple sustained notes, and the higher bass is more animated.</p>
                <p>Though I’ve definitely grown to prefer warm sawtooth basslines, this bass has a really nice quality that’s almost a square. The filter based attack is pretty sweet sounding, too.</p>
                <p>I really was happy with how the drum beats layered in at 2:16, though honestly, I was really out of practice of doing any sort of breakbeat stuff.</p>
                <p>Fun fact, this was the first song I used Gross Beat on. What’s Gross Beat? It’s something a Time Lord of Gallifrey would approve of in music. :D If you listen to the stutter effects heard in the song, mostly in the latter half, that’s where I start using Gross Beat to do some crazy time shifting stuff.</p>
                <p>Man, I really love what I did on this song.</p>
                <p>...I need to do another Homestuck remix, don’t I?</p>
