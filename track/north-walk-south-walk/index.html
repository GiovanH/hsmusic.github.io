                    <p><i>Corbin Pangilinan:</i></p>
                    <p>Last year, my freshman year of college, I was put into a dorm that was across the street from the campus proper. The first few days of the semester came just fine, but the following weeks slowly fell into the same, everyday rut and I found my routine pretty quickly tiring. For me, the start of every day would be crossing that main street in the city, which had a walk signal, as most city street crossings tend to. I'd push the button, which would evoke a very sharp click (and honestly, it was pretty satisfying to push; the morning ennui pushed me to observe that) and then the walk sign would come on, very rhythmically, stating, “WAIT.” When it came time to cross, it always repeated, “WALK SIGN IS ON. WALK SIGN IS ON. WALK SIGN IS-” at which point it would abruptly cut off and begin counting. The total time for crossing came to about thirty seconds or so, and I'd put my head down and walk along with the other freshman or whoever came to that street corner to walk at that particular time. As the semester dragged on, I started to imagine songs in order to break up the monotony a little, to the point where I would be walking across the street completely absorbed in my thoughts until the beeping of the walk signal, awaiting its next input, would come in and I'd find myself across the street. North Walk/South Walk encompasses the feeling of that 30 second time period, and indeed, the essential spirit of my freshman year in Norfolk.</p>
