            <blockquote>
                <p>She's changed, she's new now<br>She's moved on somehow<br>The pain is gone now<br>But she still needs room to breathe</p>
                <p>You've changed you're silent<br>For all those years spent<br>Explaining what it was that you really meant</p>
                <p>Now you won't say it aloud<br>You'd rather be silent and proud<br>But down inside you still lies the beast<br>If she's the reason you live<br>You'll only get what you give<br>And what you've given is no release</p>
                <p>You've changed, you've grown up<br>Your wounds have sewn up<br>Your time has shown up<br>Yet you still can't find your way</p>
                <p>No lies, no secrets<br>This is your life, now keep it<br>In time you'll see it</p>
                <p>The faces you have put on<br>Have held you back all along<br>You're a king, not a pawn, so cease<br>To be so loyally fake<br>You'll only get what you take<br>And what you've taken is no release</p>
                <p>And one day, everyone will smile again<br>We'll feel like a child again<br>And look behind us<br>And think of all the stuff that's going on<br>The stuff we're growing on</p>
                <p>It's an ashen quadrant affair<br>Except you just don't care<br>Your only aim has been to appease<br>Lay down your pride and your gun<br>You're not the only<br>Who's still looking for some release</p>
                <p>And if the rules they can bend<br>You know you still could be friends<br>But it doesn't rely on me<br>This is as far as I go<br>I only say what I know<br>And what I know is you need release</p>
